## Objective
In this project, we will build a fraud detection model based on credit card transaction data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). First, we perform EDA (exploratory data analysis) to helps us understand the data. Then, we proceed to data modelling and evaluation to select the most suitable algorithm for the data.
